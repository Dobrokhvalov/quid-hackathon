The dApp is deployed to Ropsten Testnet - https://dobrokhvalov.github.io/quid-hackathon/dist/index.html

To interact with dApp you need access to web3 client (MetaMask, Geth or other) 

## Brief background on the team and how you came up with idea

Our team:

Mikhail Dobrokhvalov - blockchain developer / finance - https://www.facebook.com/dobrokhvalov
Andrey Krylov - leader / design - https://www.facebook.com/kryptonlove

Idea came up when our blockchain developer wanted more Ether to buy more SNT tokens. He believes the price of SNT in future will grow.

## How is it innovative?


Existing lending platforms (such as lendingclub.com) don't use blockchain. Our platform based on Ethereum, which costs for maintaining webservers.

Also the loan is secured by the borrower's tokens. In the event that the borrower defaults on the smart contract creditor receive back reserve tokens that could be easily converted into ETH.


## What tool(s) / platform(s) do you use?

Embark - framework for serverless Decentralized Applications using Ethereum, IPFS and other platforms

AngularJS - Front-end Javascript Framework



## What was the biggest obstacle that your team overcame?

We planned to deploy our dApp to QTum Sparknet. 
Unfortunately, due to lack of time and lack of expereince of our team with Bitcoin Blockchain, we didn't managed to deliver dApp on QTum.
However, we will look for more documentation in future for QTum development.
